##Â Disclaimer

The code of this project is probably a mess and a bowl of spaghetti. But please, be gentle on me.

This was my first ever really big project, and I wrote it while I was still learning Ruby. Considering my skill level at that time, the fact that I even finished this project is a win for me :).
